      <p class="summary">  
    George Herman Ruth, Jr. was born February 6, 1895 to Kate Schamberger-Ruth and George Herman Ruth, Sr. He was one of eight   children of which only he and his sister, Mamie, survived past infancy. In 1902, when George was 7, his father placed him in St. Mary's Industrial School for Boys. Custody of George was signed over to the Catholic missionaries who ran the school. During the twelve years he lived at the school, George learned to read, write and play baseball under the instruction of Brother Matthias. In February 1914, George was signed with the Boston Orioles in the minor leagues under owner, Jack Dunn. He was given the nickname "Babe" by other players on the team because he was quite young, only 19, when signed.

        On July 9, 1914 George was traded to the Boston Red Sox. He played his first Major League game on July 11 against the Cleveland Naps.
        Shortly after his first season with the Red Sox, George proposed to Helen Woodford, a waitress he met in Boston. On October 17, 1914 they married. They adopted a daughter but separated in 1920. Helen died in a house fire in 1929.
Babe Ruth played for the Red Sox in the 1918 World Series and helped lead them to victory over the Chicago Cubs.
On December 16, 1919 Babe Ruth was sold to the New York Yankees. During his time with the Yankees, Babe broke his own homerun record of 54 runs and increased the record to 59 in 1921 and then again with 60 homeruns in 1927. He went on to win eight World Series with the Yankees.
     On October 1, 1932 Babe Ruth made what has become known as his famous 'called shot' while playing against the Cubs in the World Series. During the game, he pointed out to center field while at bat and on the next pitch he hit a homerun to center field.

In 1935, Babe Ruth retired from baseball. Later in life, Babe Ruth was diagnosed with cancer in his neck. He died August 16, 1948 at the age of 53.
